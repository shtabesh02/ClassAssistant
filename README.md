Class Assistant is an application designed to help students stay organized and never miss important deadlines or class sessions. It provides timely reminders for upcoming classes, assignment due dates, quizzes, and campus events. Professors can also use the platform to send general announcements to the class. In addition, the application serves as a centralized hub for frequently asked questions (FAQs) and other essential course resources.
