Class Assistant is a web application designed to enhance the university course experience by addressing a key limitation of the Blackboard platform. The project's core purpose is to provide professors with a reliable way to send announcements with file attachmentsâ€”a feature not supported by Blackboard's native email function. The application serves as a centralized platform for professors to manage and distribute course materials and for students to receive them in a timely and organized manner. 

Live Demo: https://buclassassistant.onrender.com/ 

## Core Features
Professor Admin Panel: A secure dashboard for professors to manage their courses. 

Announcement System: Professors can create announcements, attach files, and schedule them for automated distribution. 

Student Roster Management: Easily upload and manage student lists via .xlsx files. 

Event & Assignment Creation: Post important dates for quizzes and assignments. 

Student Notifications: Students can subscribe to receive timely email notifications for new announcements and events. 

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, Redux, Material-UI (MUI), CSS3
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM
- File Handling: Multer for uploads and AWS S3 for storage.
- Email Service: Nodemailer for automated notifications.
